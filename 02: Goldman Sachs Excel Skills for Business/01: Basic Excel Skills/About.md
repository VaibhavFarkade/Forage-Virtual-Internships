### Here is your task

Microsoft Excel is the most widely used spreadsheet tool in the banking and finance industry today. Regardless of whether you pursue a career in accounting, corporate finance, commercial banking or investment banking, you can expect to use Microsoft Excel on a regular basis.

*To maximize your chances of career success, mastering Excel as early as possible is key. As a new graduate at the firm, your first task is to run through a series of worked examples, designed to teach the fundamentals of Excel, as they apply to banking and finance applications.*

**Broadly, these worked examples cover:**

> Cell Basics (alignment, cell manipulation, column and row manipulation, text formats, cell formats, dates, basic formulas, copying, pasting and transposing)

> Formatting (numbers, borders, column/row alignment, text to column)

> Comments (adding, removing)

> Naming (name manager, use in formulas)

>Setting up a new sheet (header, font selection and font size, column and row sizing)
